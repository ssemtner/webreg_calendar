# UCSD Webreg to Calendar Converter

[View Deployment](https://webreg-to-calendar.shuttleapp.rs)

Converts an html download from the webreg list view to a iCal file that can be imported to Google Calendar.

Uses repeating events to avoid flooding calendar with events.

Includes all scheduled course meetings including exams.

Built with rust.

The frontend is a barebones bootstrap form at the moment, but I plan to improve it at a later time.
